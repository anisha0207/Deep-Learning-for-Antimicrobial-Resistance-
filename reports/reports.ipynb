    "# Genomic Analysis of Resistance Genes in Staphylococcus — Code Walkthrough and Output Guide\n",

    "This notebook explains the functionality of the three main code files:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- conversionFASTA.py: converts the gbff files collected from the NCBI database genome collections into FASTA for the purpose of finding resistance genes against anitbiotics in each genome. \n",
    "\n",
    "- resFinder.py: uses abricate, a collection of all health base databases that also includes resFinder that can be used to read in through the FASTA files already converted to detect sequences that have specific resistance genes to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "- results.py: compiles results of csv files including: 'basic_stats.csv', 'degradation_genes.csv', 'plasmid_genes.csv', and 'synthesis_genes.csv' using gbff files that were downloaded directly from the ncbi database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- total_gbff.py: checks to make sure, before downloading and curating results from gbff files, the total number of files that it was downloaded to aovid any duplications or extra files that may have accidentally been downloaded.\n",
