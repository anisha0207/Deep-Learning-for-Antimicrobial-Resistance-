# Deep-Learning-for-Antimicrobial-Resistance-
Summer Research in Ireland Summer 2025 through University of Galway where I optimized high-performance computing workflows for data preprocessing and resistance gene annotation in ESKAPE pathogens with over 2400 files. Leveraged Abricate for resistance gene annotation, improving prediction accuracy of antimicrobial resistance patterns.
